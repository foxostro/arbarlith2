* Bootstrap script that fetches all apps from permalinks.
* Bootstrap script with decent error checking.
* Bootstrap script patches DevIL for Mac OS 10.6
* Bootstrap script cleans up after `make install' and removes unecessary files.
* Remove PropertyBag beast, replacing with some other XML library.
* Use only 1 image format. Probably PNG.
* Use only 1 model format. Probably MD3 or something custom.
* Fix collision detection bugs and implement proper sliding against walls
* Rewrite enemy AI. Use real pathfinding and interesting behavior.
* Rework animations so that things like particle effects and spells are tied more closely to the movement of the character.
* Rework, rethink game scripting
* Rework, rethink map format. Want Towers, Airships, Floating Islands. Need more than simple dungeons.
* Rigidly separate Model, View, and Controller
* Load faster
* Controller hotplugging
* Serious soul searching as to the element of Fun.
* It's fun to fight enemy spawners: Houses, Necromancers, Summoners
* Zelda-esque block pushing puzzles and teleportation?
* The "chained" idea may be able to be partially incorporated.
* The "rock'n'roll brawler" idea may be able to be partially incorporated.
* The "darkness" gameplay mechanic may be able to support part of one level.
* The "Floating Islands / Little Prince" idea may be able to be incorporated by merging with the "Airships" idea.
* Current spells are sorta boring elemental cliches. Can these be improved?
