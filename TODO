TODO
=====
The game, as written, is not very fun. Much can be done to improve the gameplay. Even so, the point of this project is not to
improve the gameplay in major ways, but to focus on improvements to infrastructure. The gameplay may be tweaked, but no major
elements will be added, removed, or drastically modified. Those sorts of changes would be best saved for another game which
forks from this game.

* Needs a better Mac app icon
* Use only 1 image format. Probably PNG.
* Use only 1 model format. Probably MD3 or something custom.
* Fix collision detection bugs and implement proper sliding against walls
* It's possible to quickly switch between player animations in a way that's really disconcerting.
* Needs a minimum attack rate.
* No decent indication is given to the user that attacks can be Charged Up.
* Hit sparks
* Improved enemy AI. That is, real pathfinding, varied behaviors, &c.
* Controller hotplugging
* Rigidly separate Model, View, and Controller
* Load faster
