A material is responsible for data specific to an object that may be used as
input to an Effect.  This input is stored in VRAM in the form of texture
images, however, there is no reason why textures can not simply be used as a
two dimensional array of data input that is mapped to certain regions of
geometry. This is actually the case when a gloss map or a bump map is
specified in a texture.  Or when one is used to say, create a normalization
cube map for FFP bump mapping.
