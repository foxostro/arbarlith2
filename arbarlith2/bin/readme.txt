Back story
-----------

(Beginning)

Ever since Mael, the God of Chaos, fell at his hand, the young hero Aelyn was revered as the champion of Arbarlith, the war between men and Gods.  His home village prospered, and there was peace for a time.

However, the Chaos Rune that Aelyn had used to defeat Mael was gathering strength within him.  His psyche, once whole, slowly began to be torn apart as he tried to contain the captured power of the Chaos God that was within him.

Convinced that he was Mael himself, Aelyn set out from the village once again to battle the demons of his past...

(After Stage 1)

Aelyn surveyed the wrecked body of the demon beast.  Not convinced of his might, he trudged on through a pathway that had opened up in the old, crumbling rock.

The young warrior found himself in a strange world outside of his valley, and he marked this as the beginning of his new reign as the new God of Chaos.

(After Stage 2)

Mael's power was so strong in Aelyn that even the old gods took notice.  "It is unheard of," they said, "that a human should bear the power of a god!"  Not to be bested by a mere human, the gods took Aelyn to their city in the sky to pass judgment upon him, but Mael's spirit would not be stifled.

(After Stage 3)

Mael claimed the heavenly throne as the old gods lay dead before him.  The sky rained fire and the seas boiled and turned to blood.  Even the village Aelyn used to call home was razed by the conflagration.  The world turned to darkness as Mael's spirit continued to grow stronger.

Though somewhere, in a miniscule corner of his mind, Aelyn's soul flickered weakly...

+THE END+

(If you Die)

Aelyn's body, unable to support Mael's spirit any longer, collapsed on the cold floor as he felt the life that was once in him depart.  His eyes slowly closed as he felt the power of the Rune converge into a small stone, which he held in his hand, for some poor hapless traveler to be posessed once more...
